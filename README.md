## Project Structure

Each Android application have their a specific folder with their own workflows.
These are all the workflows you have for:

- ![Telegram](./assets/telegram-icon-24.png) [Telegram](./flows-telegram)
<font color="red">(Coming soon)</font>

<font color="red">(Coming soon)</font>
- ![GitHub](assets/github-icon-24.png)  [GitHub](./flows-github)
<font color="red">(Coming soon)</font>

I also have in mind some useful integration ones between each others. E.g.

- Backup / Restore apps configuration to any cloud service.
- Detect my workflows that do the same action for each app, and execute it all together.
